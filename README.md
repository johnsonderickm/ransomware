# Ransomware

Ransomware is a type of malicious software (malware) that is designed to encrypt a victim's files or lock them out of their computer system until a ransom is paid to the attacker. The ransomware encrypts the victim's files using a strong encryption algorithm, making them inaccessible without the decryption key, which only the attacker possesses.

The encrypt.py encrypts the files in the working directory with a random generated key. The key can also be encrypted once the backup for the key is done. 
The decrypt.py helps to decrypt the file using the key.
